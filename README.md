Data Exploration and Classification Models for Loan Prediction

This is a project where I try to predict if a loan application will be approved or not. 
In general, this is a classification problem where we try to predict if an application (row in data) will be approved (1) or not approved (0).

I tackle this problem by trying different types of classification models and comparing them (using ROC)

Of course, before starting to build models, first I explore the data and try to understand the basic statistics which will give an idea on how to proceed. 
Another important part before the model building is to actually clean, prepare and transform the dataso that it will be useful and better for classification
